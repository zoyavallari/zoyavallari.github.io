I am an experimental particle physicist studying small fundamental particles called neutrinos.
Neutrinos come in three flavors and oscillate from one kind to another depending on their energy and the distance traveled.
The detection of neutrino oscillations provided conclusive evidence that neutrinos are massive.
This remains the first and only experimental confirmation of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Today, neutrinos continue to provide a rich environment to explore fundamental physics.
I work on the flagship US experiments studying long-baseline neutrino oscillations, <a href='https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/'>NOvA</a>, and <a href='https://www.dunescience.org/'>DUNE</a>.
Precise measurement of the oscillation parameters gives us insight into the fundamental physics theories which govern how particles interact with each other.

Precise measurement of the oscillation parameters will unambiguously resolve questions such as the neutrino mass ordering and present a remarkable potential to discover CP violation in neutrinos, giving us 
valuable insight into the fundamental physics theories.
