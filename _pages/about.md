I am an experimental particle physicist studying small fundamental particles called neutrinos.
Neutrinos come in three flavors and oscillate from one kind to another depending on their energy and the distance traveled.
I work on the flagship US experiments studying long-baseline neutrino oscillations, <a href='https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/'>NOvA</a> and <a href='https://www.dunescience.org/'>DUNE</a>.
Precise measurement of the oscillation parameters gives us insight into the fundamental physics theories which govern how particles interact with each other.
