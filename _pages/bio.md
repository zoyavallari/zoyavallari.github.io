<p>&#128075; I am Zoya! <br>
If you are looking for my CV, you can find it <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_ZoyaVallari.pdf">here</a>! </p>


<p> I grew up in Allahabad, India. It is a small city in North-Central India. 
I went to St. Stephen's College, Delhi University for my undergraduate and did a M.Sc in physics at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
I moved to New York for my PhD at Stony Brook University in 2012 and then over to west coast in Pasadena for my postdoc in 2019. </p>

<p> I did not have a last name until recently.
Growing up, I was simply "Zoya" (like Lizzo or Zendaya!).
However, publication and immigration were not on-board with this idea so I got a brand new last name during my grad school.
(Perhaps, I should have chosen to be a rockstar instead!)
I chose to be a "Vallari" after seriously considering "AAA" which would have eternally reserved the first author spot for me in all collaboration papers .</p>



<p> Apart from physics, I do capoeira. It is an Afro-Brazilian martial-arts with a deep rooted history in Black liberation.
I trained as a Kathak (Indian classical dance) dancer throughout my childhood, for almost 15 years.
I am obsessed with mangoes and I am extremely fond of sunshine. </p>
